# MNN - Modern News Network Viewer

## Project Description
MNN (Modern News Network Viewer) is an ASP.NET MVC application designed to display news articles fetched from the NewsOrg API. The application's interface is inspired by CNN, ensuring a high level of readability and ease of navigation. MNN utilizes ViewComponents to manage the UI components and to filter news content effectively, making the user experience both intuitive and responsive.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic News Display**: Articles are dynamically fetched using HTTP GET requests from the NewsOrg API.
- **CNN-inspired UI**: The user interface mimics the CNN website for a familiar and user-friendly browsing experience.
- **Efficient Filtering**: Articles can be filtered directly through the UI, allowing users to find news that matches their interests quickly.
- **Service Layer Architecture**: All business logic related to data fetching and operations is handled centrally in the service layer.
- **Modular ViewComponents**: Uses ViewComponents for a clean and maintainable codebase, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.


## Usage
After launching the application, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser to start exploring the news articles. Utilize the filtering options provided to personalize the news feed according to your preferences.
